            <br>
            2-The loud whirring or buzzing
            <br>
            sound you hear is an all-male

            2-Camels have three sets of eyelids 
            <br>
            and two rows of eyelashes to keep 
            <br>
            sand out of their eyes.
            <br>
            3-Camels have thick lips which let 
            <br>
            them forage for thorny plants other
            <br>
            animals can't eat.
